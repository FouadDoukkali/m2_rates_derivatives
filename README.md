# m2_rates_derivatives
Rates derivatives project realized in my final year.

Used models were stochastic, therefore first issue was determining how brownian motions had to be simulated:
Marsaglia,
Box-Muller,
Donsker

Then models were fitted against swap rates.
Finally rates derivatives, caplet and floorlets were priced. A ZC curve was also deduced from the implied models.
